# Generative-Adversarial-Network-GAN-Supply-Chain
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based model to enhance credit risk identification in supply chains.

Problem Scope:
Credit risk in supply chains can propagate across networks, affecting the financial stability of industries like manufacturing, distribution, and services. Traditional models (e.g., logistic regression) struggle with dynamic, sequential, and imbalanced datasets.

GAN Model:

Generator: Produces synthetic credit risk data to augment training datasets.
Discriminator: Classifies data as real or synthetic, helping refine the generator's outputs.
Objective: Improve predictive accuracy by leveraging synthetic data for better training and capturing temporal dependencies.
Industries Studied:

Manufacturing (steel), Distribution (pharmaceuticals), and Services (e-commerce).
Highlighted the unique patterns of credit risk contagion in each.
Performance:
The GAN model outperformed traditional methods, achieving higher accuracy, recall, and F1 scores due to its ability to generate high-quality synthetic data.
